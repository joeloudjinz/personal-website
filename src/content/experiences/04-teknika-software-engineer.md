In this role, I took on a hybrid leadership position, acting as the Project Manager and Product Owner for a small team
of four. I was responsible for managing the product backlog, which involved prioritizing new features and addressing
bugs. Alongside these duties, I continued to be a hands-on developer, building features for both the .NET backend and
Angular frontend.
