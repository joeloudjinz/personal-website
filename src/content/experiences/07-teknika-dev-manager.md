This period was the busiest chapter in my career. My role grew beyond my previous duties to also cover leadership for
the mobile and web frontend teams. My work became more about making high-level architectural decisions and guiding team
members, but I still wrote code and fixed problems when needed. I worked very closely with other leaders,
like [Ryan Ramshandar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanramchandar/), a talented Flutter engineer who led the mobile side
of our Framework and client projects.

As a manager, I became responsible for helping grow our technical teams. I interviewed candidates for various roles like
.NET, Angular, and Ruby on Rails developers, with experience ranging from mid-level all the way to experts from Toptal.
I am particularly proud that a web developer I helped hire was later promoted to Technical Lead, which proved my sharp
sight towards talented individuals.

My duties also grew to include working more directly with company leaders. I provided high-level time estimates for
projects and wrote detailed reports that analyzed new project ideas. These reports were very helpful to the leadership
board in deciding which projects to focus on. Working with project managers and product owners, I also gave regular
progress updates and made sure we stayed true to the client's vision.

Even though I was focused more on the big picture, I remained a hands-on technical leader. I often jumped in to help
solve major issues and remove roadblocks for the development teams when they needed my skills. I continued to lead and
mentor the backend team, while also sharing the project's vision with the web and mobile engineers.

The most valuable part of this job was the people. I was lucky to work with such a talented and good team, including
[Ayoub Gourine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gourine-ayoub-002a701bb/), [Ryan Ramshandar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanramchandar/),
and [Michael Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-knight-095619207/). Working with them made this one of the best
experiences of my career.
