In this role, my focus shifted to maintaining and enhancing key client projects. I supported several applications built
with a .NET Core backend, MySQL databases, and an Angular frontend. I consistently leveraged my debugging skills to
identify the root cause of issues across different environments and implement timely fixes.

A core responsibility was ensuring the continuous delivery of improvements and new features to various environments on
AWS. To support this, I managed project backlogs to align with evolving client requirements and regularly communicated
project progress and insights with team members and management.

My time with the company concluded for a combination of personal and professional reasons. I remain grateful for the
valuable experience and the opportunities provided by the leadership of the company.
