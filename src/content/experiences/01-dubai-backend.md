My professional journey began right after university when I joined Sweedy Portal in Dubai as a Backend Engineer. I was
part of an ambitious project to build a comprehensive school management system from the ground upâ€”a much-needed solution
for schools across the GCC region at that time.

From the start, I played a key role in shaping the project's technical direction. I selected Laravel and Vue.js as the
core technology stack and provided guidance and support to my team members. As the lead on the backend, I architected
the system using Clean Architecture and SOLID principles to ensure our code was both robust and easy to maintain. My
responsibilities also included defining the data model, optimizing the database, and writing unit and integration tests
to guarantee feature stability. This foundational experience concluded when I left to fulfill my mandatory military
service.
