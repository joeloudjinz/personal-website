After completing my military service, I joined Assistt, a U.S. startup building a mobile app for neighborhood odd-jobs.
Following an interview with the CEO and CTO, I was hired as a Fullstack Engineer and quickly became deeply involved in
the product's development.
This role proved to be one of the most formative experiences of my career. Working closely with the CTO, Bryan Walsh, I
contributed to key architectural decisions and best practices across the entire tech stack. My work spanned the
backend (NestJS), the mobile app (Flutter), and the web admin portal (Angular). I also managed the build and deployment
process for both Android and iOS. Bryan's mentorship was invaluable, and his guidance played a significant part in
shaping the engineer I am today.
Over the course of a year, we successfully built an MVP, participated in accelerators, and launched the app. When the
initial product didn't gain the expected traction, the founders decided to pivot towards a new venture: a white-label,
peer-to-peer marketplace platform. This strategic shift created a new opportunity for me, and I was promoted to Backend
Team Lead to help guide the new technical direction.
