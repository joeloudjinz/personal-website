As Backend Team Lead for a marketplace platform, I oversaw the entire development lifecycle for our .NET backend, from
initial design to final deployment. A significant part of my role was providing mentorship and technical guidance to the
development team. I also worked closely with the CTO on high-level architectural decisions and performed code reviews to
maintain quality.
