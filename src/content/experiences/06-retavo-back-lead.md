In my new role as Backend Team Lead, I was responsible for guiding the development of our white-label marketplace
platform, Retavo. My role quickly expanded beyond technical execution; I collaborated directly with the startup's
leadership in brainstorming sessions, helping shape the product vision by offering both technical and business
perspectives.
Continuing my close collaboration with the CTO, I focused on architecting and building a modular backend using .NET and
C# while also contributing to the Angular frontend. This position required me to quickly learn the .NET ecosystem, a
challenge I embraced with support from our CTO.
Beyond my own technical contributions, I was responsible for mentoring and guiding the development team. I ensured
everyone had a clear understanding of the product vision and the technologies we were using. Our first major project was
a complex e-commerce marketplace for a client, designed to handle user management, products, orders, payments, shipping,
and content management.
While the technical team was making excellent progress, the company unfortunately faced financial difficulties and
ceased operations in April 2023. Although it was difficult to see the journey end, the experience was incredibly
valuable. I am grateful for the opportunity to have led such a talented and passionate team, and the knowledge I gained
continues to shape my career.
