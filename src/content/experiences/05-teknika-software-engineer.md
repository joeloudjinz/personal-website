Transitioning to TeknikaCorp, I continued to lead the development for Rainey's Closet as a full-time employee. In this
role, I managed a cross-functional team of five, which included a UI/UX designer, two frontend engineers, and a QA
engineer, while I served as the team's full-stack developer.

A key initiative was a complete UI/UX overhaul of the platform. I collaborated with the designer and led the frontend
engineers in translating the new designs into a functional Angular web app. I was also solely responsible for all
backend development and worked closely with our QA engineer to test the platform, identify bugs, and ensure a
high-quality user experience. Alongside my technical duties, I continued to manage the product backlog, lead the
meetings, translate client requirements into actionable tasks, and maintain project documentation. Following several
development cycles, the project was put on hold for unknown reasons.

Recognizing my contributions and versatile skill set, the company leadership promoted me to lead a backend team, this
time for a larger and an ambitious project.
