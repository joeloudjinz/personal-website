During this time, I worked directly with [Erica Richards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericarichards/), the owner of
Rainey's Closet and the first client for the Retavo platform. Her vision was to create a high-end marketplace where
people could buy, sell, or rent clothing, with the platform handling core logistics like shipping, payments, taxes, and
customer support.

My primary role was to bridge the gap between her business goals and the technical execution. I translated her vision
into detailed requirements, managed the product backlog, and provided technical insights to inform key decisions. In
addition to these product ownership responsibilities, I continued to develop features and fixes using .NET and Angular.
I also managed manual deployments to AWS and PlanetScale, ensuring the client and potential investors could review our
progress in real-time.

This experience was instrumental in developing my skills in product ownership and project management. Ultimately, due to
financial constraints, the project's development was outsourced to a third-party company, TeknikaCorp. Based on the
trust we had built, I was asked to continue my work on the project, which led to the next chapter of my career.
