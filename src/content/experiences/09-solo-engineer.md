Working as a solo engineer, I took the opportunity to focus on learning and building with new technologies.

- Studying System Design: I dedicated time to the core principles of system design to improve how I build software. To
  deepen my own understanding and help others, I began writing about and sharing what I learned on LinkedIn.

- Contributing to Open Source: I enjoy working with the developer community. I collaborated with other programmers to
  create the .NET version of a library that validates Algerian bank account details (RIB & RIP). I also created and
  published several of my own packages on GitHub, making them available to developers through registries like NuGet.

- Using AI to Code Faster: I brought AI tools into my daily workflow to speed up my projects. I used AI agents like
  Gemini CLI and Qwen3 Coder, along with tools like GitHub Spec-Kit, to help write code and fix bugs more efficiently. I
  found that learning to write clear, specific prompts was the key to getting the best results.

- Exploring New Frameworks: I dove into modern web technologies by building my personal website with Astro, a fast and
  lightweight framework. I also experimented with the LangChain and LangGraph libraries to create applications that use
  AI. At the same time, I continued to strengthen my existing skills in NestJS, Angular, Python and Flutter.
