Every great application starts with a hidden engine. My story begins by designing that core systemâ€”the strong, silent
foundation that will power everything. I lead the team that builds this engine, making sure it's secure, fast, and ready
to grow. We create the pathways (APIs) that allow every part of the application to work together perfectly, resulting in
a reliable system built for the long haul.
