Bridging the gap between a powerful idea and the team that will build it. I start by listening to the
client's vision and understanding what users truly need. I then translate those needs into a clear, actionable plan for
the developers. By steering the product's direction from the very beginning, I ensure that the final result isn't just
well-built software, but the right software that truly satisfies users and succeeds in the market.
