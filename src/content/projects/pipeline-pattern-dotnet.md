A sophisticated .NET pipeline processing library that enables building complex data processing workflows through a
fluent API. Provides a robust and extensible framework for processing data through a series of configurable, composable,
and resilient steps. Features include sequential, parallel, conditional, and sub-pipeline execution, resource
sharing with thread-safe operations, comprehensive error handling (retry policy, circuit breaker policy, fallback
policy, circuit breaker strategy, retry with backoff strategy), pipeline validation with dependency checking,
performance monitoring with metrics collection, cancellation support, and asynchronous operations.
