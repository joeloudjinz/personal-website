As a PM/PO in Teknika, I worked closely with Abdullah on several projects, one of which we collaborated on practically
from concept to completion. As a Backend Team Lead, he really showed his technical and leadership strengths.
He was able to tackle high-level requirements and design effective backend solutions and break them into tasks, but he
was also able to assess the team members and delegate tasks appropriately. He showed an impressive ability to recognize
different developers strengths and weaknesses, and help them grow.

As Backend Team Lead, Abdullah was able to maintain good developer morale, even during challenging stretches of the
project. He also helped them to improve and take on new challenges. Thanks to his guidance, every developer on the team
grew in skill and confidence, and one even started taking on management responsibilities himself by the end of the
project.
On top of all this, Abdullah is incredibly easy to work with. He's professional, responsive, and has a positive,
optimistic attitude, even in high-pressure situations.

I really enjoyed working with Abdullah and have no doubt he'll be a huge asset to any team or project he's part of.
