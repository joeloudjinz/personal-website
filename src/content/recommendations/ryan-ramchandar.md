<p class="text-white">
I had the pleasure of working with Abdellah at Teknika, and his technical skills and collaborative nature stood out. He
worked extensively with C# back-end services and managed deployments, playing a crucial role in our projects' success.
Abdellah was proactive about solving challenges, even anticipating issues before they arose. Ready to take on leadership
roles, he helped push our projects along in the right direction.

I particularly enjoyed our time working together to debug problems and navigate complex workflows. His patience and
logical approach made the process both effective and enjoyable. Simply put, Abdellah is a great teammate on any project,
and anyone would be fortunate to have him on their team.
