<p class="text-white">
I have worked with Abdellah for over two years developing my peer to peer marketplace platform. He has been instrumental
and a team lead since the beginning. He showed interest in learning and understanding my business to build the best
platform possible. He is intuitive and showed dedication, genuine care, and creativity throughout the process, in
addition to his superior knowledge and development skills. I can't recommend him enough.
